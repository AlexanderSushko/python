Though not the first fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes is arguably the best known.[1] 
By the 1990s there were already over 25,000 stage adaptations, films, television productions and publications 
featuring the detective,[2] and Guinness World Records lists him as the most portrayed literary human character 
in film and television history.[3] Holmes's popularity and fame are such that many have believed him to be not a 
fictional character but a real individual;[4][5] numerous literary and fan societies have been founded on this pretence. 
Avid readers of the Holmes stories helped create the modern practice of fandom.[6] The character and stories have had a profound 
and lasting effect on mystery writing and popular culture as a whole, with the original tales as well as thousands written by authors 
other than Conan Doyle being adapted into stage and radio plays, television, films, video games, and other media for over one hundred years.
